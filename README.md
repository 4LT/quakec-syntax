# QuakeC Syntax

This is a language/grammar definition for QuakeC, including features from [FTEQCC](https://github.com/fte-team/fteqw).  Its intent is to be provided for use with [linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist) to support syntax highlighting while browsing QuakeC (`.qc`) files.  I have no intention of publishing it as a VS Code extension, though it may be used as one.

## Debugging

Open with VS Code and run the debugger (F5)
